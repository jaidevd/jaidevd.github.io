Hello, World!
-------------

I'm a data scientist based in New Delhi, India. I build data-driven products
and the tooling around them for a living. My research interests are in signal
processing, machine learning and computational harmonic analysis. I'm obsessed with applications
of machine learning and statistics in day-to-day data and problems.
