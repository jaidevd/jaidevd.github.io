<h1 class="post-title">The Bridge of Asses: Learning Coding with Novices</h1>
    
    <time>August 27, 2025</time>
    
    <div>
        <p>
        <p>Over the last few years, I have been deeply involved with the <a href="https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/">IIT-M Programme in
Data Science &amp; Applications</a> - as a student, a mentor and an analytics
consultant. The programme provides diplomas and bachelor’s degrees in data
science and applications. I’m often asked why I’m so invested in the programme -
especially since I’m already an experienced data scientist.</p>
<p>At least three people are mad at me for being in the programme. One of them
thinks that I’ve unfairly claimed a higher education seat I don’t need - which
would be true if this was a conventional program with limited seats. But it&rsquo;s a
MOOC.</p>
<p>Another person thinks that professionals like myself (especially those who’ve
spent a fair time in data science and software development) are pulling the
grading curves to the right. I promise you - we’re not. First of all, kids these
days are a lot smarter than I. Secondly, practising data science is one thing,
but getting good grades and writing exams is a different game. Third, the
program doesn&rsquo;t grade us on a curve anyway. A CGPA of 9.0<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> means that I
consistently demonstrated mastery of 90% of the material. It does not mean that
I am 90% as smart as the smartest student.</p>
<p>The third person who thinks I have no business being here is my wife. She
insists that the right time for studies was ten years ago (when I actually went
to college but never studied, not for exams anyway), and the time I spend
studying <em>now</em> is time stolen from her. She’s right on both counts. Me not
studying hard enough back then, and studying too hard now, have both taken
something from her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that I have no business being in this programme. But I&rsquo;ve rarely been
motivated by reasonable things.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come for the degree. I came because I teach machine learning courses
myself, and I wanted to see what IIT Madras was really up to. I was shocked that
IIT Madras was offering <em>degrees</em> without a JEE score. I went in only to audit
some of the courses, and see if they really knew what they were doing. In fact,
I once asked <a href="https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/andrew/">Prof Andrew Thangaraj</a>, the coordinator of the programme, what he
and his team were thinking when they decided to open the floodgates. He laughed
and said, &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I came in as a spectator, but then I started seeing this programme as a
massive social experiment. Since I&rsquo;d been teaching this stuff myself, I was
curious about what happens when you take high-quality educational content and
make it available <em>en masse</em>: anyone can apply as long as they’ve finished high
school, from anywhere, no age limits either. What you get is the largest, most
diverse MOOC in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that I can&rsquo;t furnish the exact numbers here, but suffice it to say
that we&rsquo;ve got people from their late teens to their early 80s, from various
socio-economic backgrounds. The programme also boasts a better sex ratio than
most other engineering or science curricula anywhere else in the country. People
can come from any or no professional background. There are people like myself,
experienced programmers and data scientists who are here just for fun - without
the pressure of having to worry about getting jobs. On the other hand there are
people who’ve never seen a computer. There are seniors and retired professionals
who are familiar with computers and
programming, but not quite in the same way that would be suitable for data
science. There are also people who are here primarily to upskill and get jobs.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the content too, spans the whole spectrum - courses range from trivial to backbreaking. There are courses in
English, mathematics, statistics, databases, programming languages, shallow and
deep ML, and specialized topics like reinforcement learning too. There were
courses where I scored a top grade without lifting a finger. There were also
courses where the entire class got slaughtered.</p>
<p>What we have here are two singularities - the varying complexity of the content
and the varying backgrounds, skills, hopes and aspirations of the people
consuming that content.</p>
<p>The exchanges and discussions which emerge from the collision of these two
singularities are nothing short of mind-boggling. These discussions, at the very
least, are useful to those involved. And they can be truly enlightening if
they’re summarized, critiqued and documented properly.</p>
<p>What you are reading is a small attempt at doing just that.</p>
<hr>
<p>We use a <a href="https://discourse.org">Discourse</a> instance as our discussion forum.
It’s open to all who enrol in the programme to discuss everything from homework
to operations and logistics. For as long as I was in the programme, I was
addicted to the forum - it was the first tab I opened every morning, and the
last I closed before I left my desk. In the beginning, when we onboarded some of
the first batches onto Discourse, most of us were gradually being exposed to
programming and data science for the first time. This meant that we had
newcomers exposed to many different technologies. For instance, stuff like
numpy, pandas, sklearn and bash form the center of some of the courses offered
in the diploma year. Many of these tools are my very livelihood. I’ve been using
them for a decade - I’ve done my 10000 hours<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. So I was able to go through these
courses with relatively little effort. The time that I saved went into writing
long post and replies on Discourse.</p>
<p>It turns out that I’ve written about a thousand posts on Discourse, nearly one
for every day that I was enrolled in the program. They span lots of topics, but
three overarching themes emerged from them - code, tools and libraries, and

<p>This post focuses on the first item - <em>code</em>. I’ve learnt a lot about how people
code - not about coding itself, not even about just the <em>act</em> of coding, but how
people (novices and experts alike) <em>react</em> to code, interpret it, and develop
habits around it.</p>
<h2 id="the-bridge-of-asses">The Bridge of Asses</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Medieval students called the moment at which casual learners fail the <em>pons
asinorum</em>, or “bridge of asses.” The term was inspired by Proposition 5 of
Euclid’s Elements I, the first truly difficult idea in the book. Those who
crossed the bridge would go on to master geometry; those who didn’t would
remain dabblers. Section 4.3 of “Beginning Visual C++,” on “Dynamic Memory
Allocation,” was my bridge of asses. I did not cross.</p>
<p>- James Somers, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft"><em>A Coder Considers the Waning Days of the
Craft</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who doesn’t want to remain a ‘dabbler’ must cross their own <em>pons
asinorum</em>. I crossed mine a bit late, in the last year of my bachelor’s course
in electronics engineering. I realized that if I were to do machine learning
instead of electronics, I’d have to write MATLAB instead of HDL and embedded C.
And if I were to do it really well, I’d have to use a <em>real</em> programming
language, like Python<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. That was my bridge of asses. Crossing it consisted of
understanding that there exists a whole world outside the paradigm of
array-oriented computing.</p>
<p>The <em>Pons Asinorum</em> of the foundation level of the BS Degree Programme is also a
course on Python programming. Rude as it may sound, there’s no hope in data
science and applications for those who can’t write Python code. The Python
course occurs within the first year of the programme, and acts as a ruthless
filter. It’s one of the most difficult courses in the entire programme. At any
given time there are a few thousand students enrolled in that course, and many
of them take five or six attempts to pass it. For comparison, the second most
difficult course is Maths 2 (linear algebra and multivariate calculus), where
the slowest students take up to four attempts. At some level, this appears very
strange - why would Python - one of the simplest programming languages - be
<em>more</em> difficult to master than advanced mathematics? And isn’t mathematics a
language in itself, too?</p>

</div>

<p>But it is what it is. You can’t hope to get much done in data science and
applications without some aptitude in Python. So it’s safe to say that despite
its ruthlessness, the bridge of asses is placed correctly. As to why it is so
narrow, I think the answer lies in how novices react to computer code.</p>
<h2 id="scalpels-not-sledgehammers">Scalpels, not Sledgehammers</h2>
<p>The one thing that characterized my own first struggle with general purpose
programming - 15 years ago - was frequent rage-quitting. Code looked horribly
obscure to me. Reading pages and pages of it gave me a frightful nausea. If the
sight of Borland C++ GUI makes you nostalgic, I envy you. In me it still invokes
fear. But I did have grades riding on it, so I had no choice but to keep reading
and trying to comprehend it in vain.</p>
<p>Code looked like a dark, viscous, looming mass of tar, hovering ominously above
my desk. It felt large enough to swallow you whole. You&rsquo;re backed up against a
wall. It slowly closes in on you. It will eventually drown you. It also seems to
have magical powers - when you swing a bat at it, it hardens like stone. The bat
breaks against it. But when you step back and stop exerting force, it starts
dripping once again with tar, giving you the fleeting impression that it may
perhaps be pliable after all, giving you hope that you may yet conquer this
monstrosity.</p>
<p>So you lash out again, and once again the mass hardens and you break yet another
weapon. You realize that the amorphous, intangible mass is impenetrable to blunt
force. But maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;ll disintegrate if you poke it at just the
right spot. You realize that what you needed, really, was a scalpel, not a
sledgehammer. But now it’s too late. You’ve been badly tarred and feathered. And
when, weeks later, you face another inscrutable block of code-tar, you might not
even remember what worked or failed the last time. You are condemned to
eternally swing bats at something that is invulnerable to force.</p>
<p>&hellip; at least that&rsquo;s what I wrote in my journal back then. But there are others
who have had similar experiences. No wonder Fred Brooks wrote about the <em>Tar</em>
Pit - there’s something black and viscous and dirty about incomprehensible code.
<a href="https://anuvrat.in/">Anuvrat Parashar</a> compares incomprehensible code to an almost-finished sweater -
one that can be unravelled if only you&rsquo;d find the right thread to pull.</p>
<p>Now, after fifteen years, code certainly doesn’t scare me. And only sometimes
nauseates me.</p>
<p>I suspect that most people - whether experts or novices - have similar reactions
when they start reading code. At first glance, a block of code looks as
indecipherable and as arcane to an expert as it looks to a novice. The
difference is that the expert does not feel intimated. The expert’s furrowed
brows reflects an attempt at comprehension (and sometimes, it reflects disgust).
Nobody, no matter how experienced, are fully comfortable with code at first
glance.</p>
<p>To make matters worse for novices, the hieroglyphs of variables, functions and
loops scare them further away from <em>reading</em> the code. It becomes even more
magical, even more forbidding. Not to mention the pressing assignment deadlines,
if you&rsquo;re in the middle of a programming course. Ultimately, the novice’s
reaction to code becomes haphazard instead of comprehensive. As a result, most
questions on Discourse come in the form of a screenshot of code followed by a
short question like “why isn’t this working?” or “what’s wrong with this code?”.</p>
<p>If you’re reading code on GitHub or in your IDE, the environment has already
primed you for reading code. But when code appears interspersed with natural
language, as in textbooks, blogs, or API documentation, it takes a few seconds
for the brain to switch from comprehending natural language to comprehending
code. If you’re reading English, your eyes are confidently moving from left to
right, and then from top to bottom. But if you’re reading code, is this
left-right-top-bottom movement of the eyes always the most efficient? Maybe
sometimes, if you are presented with a simple function or a short script. But if
you’re presented with a whole Python module or a Java class, your eyes might
jump around all over the screen until you find the entry point - which could be
a class constructor, a command line argument parser, a function, etc.</p>
<p>The point is that the most important part of code could appear anywhere in it.
On the other hand, in a paragraph of English text (assuming it’s not written by
James Joyce or William Faulkner), we know where the most important
bits are likely to be. Moreover, natural language doesn’t keep you guessing. You
can keep following the left-right-top-bottom movement of your eyes until you
find what you’re looking for. In code, there’s no such sure-shot method for
finding things.</p>
<p>That’s why I suspect that the visceral reaction of most people - whether experts
or novices - to code is some form of <em>discomfort.</em> It is certainly not
comprehension. I ran a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaidevd_activity-7149649672888868864-7uMZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAL90eEB7pk3c9z5LwAvQOvgXITcnw1sOFg">few</a> <a href="https://x.com/jaidevd/status/1743883427534049335">polls</a> to see how many people agree with me. It
turns out that hell is indeed other people’s code. Some of us are optimistic
about foreign code - their instant reaction is excitement or curiosity - Nerds!
I tell you&hellip;</p>
<p>But those who said that their reaction is comprehension are straight up lying.</p>
<p>Everyone takes a second or two to get accustomed to reading code. It is during
this short time that the differences between the thoughts of experts and novices
is most stark.</p>
<p>After the initial glance at a snippet, the expert starts behaving like a trained
bloodhound. They shut off all external noise and focus rapidly. They then
proceed to look for the entry point, scrolling up and down through the code,
until they find their quarry. Only when the entry point is isolated (by making a
note of which function, statement, or line of code holds the solution) do they
allow themselves the fleeting pleasure of comprehension. But their work isn’t
done yet. The entry point is but the root of the tree. They have yet to parse
the whole tree to figure out how stuff works. After a brief pause, the
bloodhound is at work again.</p>
<p>All this is incredibly difficult for a novice - not least because it cannot be
taught. That is why, novices react with discomfort and stay in that same state,
until the discomfort compounds into panic and they (at least temporarily) give
up.</p>
<p>This effect of code-induced-disorientation is further amplified when students
are chasing deadlines and when they’re appearing for exams. Most of us are
chronic procrastinators (including myself - I’m saying this without judgement,
no shame in it). When we read code that <em>really</em> needs to be understood quickly,
it’s almost always too late. If you’ve got only a few hours left to finish a
daunting assignment, even a relatively small block of code can look <em>very</em>
scary. Fear gets the best of even the best of us.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, it’s not surprising that an overwhelming amount of Discourse
threads are about what some piece of code does, and why it may not work. The
antidote to obscure code is what I’d call human-centric code.</p>
<h2 id="human-centric-code">Human-Centric Code</h2>
<p><em>The Internship (2013)</em> is a movie about what happens when a couple of men with
<em>zero</em> technical skills end up in an internship at Google. Much of it is a
caricature of how hard it is for a couple of out-of-work, middle-aged,
technologically-impaired and somewhat obnoxious salesmen to find good jobs, and
how they save their careers with little more than their street-smarts and life
experience.</p>
<p>At one point in the movie, teams of interns have been tasked with debugging an
app which has 2 million lines of code (perhaps a cinematic exaggeration - who
knows?). As soon as the problem is stated, the experts in the team - young
students, coders and a Google PM - launch into a variety of strategies to solve
the problem. You can hear them say various plausible phrases like “scan the
logs”, “see what exceptions were thrown”, “read the user reports”, etc. The
protagonists, however, are left mumbling nonsense to themselves. They are so
clueless, they don’t know how clueless they are.</p>
<p>But even though it is ignored by the rest of their team, they do make one very
good point. They keep insisting that “Someone wrote that code. All we have to do
is find them.” They end up being hilariously pranked, but recognising that there
is a human behind a given piece of code can be a very useful insight.</p>
<p>I’m not even talking about knowing exactly <em>who</em> wrote a particular piece of
code. The first step is to simply acknowledge <em>that</em> a piece of code was written
by one or more humans. In the post-genAI world, recognizing the touch of a human
is going to be all the more insightful. The next step, then, is to start
arranging a <em>persona</em> around the authors. The people who design coding problems
in exams do not have the same <em>persona</em> as the people who write jupyter
notebooks on Kaggle. Knowing the persona even vaguely can help us find the
motivations behind code. A programming exam is <em>designed</em> to be tricky to read
and debug. A pandas tutorial is not.</p>
<p>The realization that humans are behind code is the cornerstone of the entire
edifice of <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html">literate programming</a>. It is also why communities of programmers who
maintain software projects have <em>coding standards</em>. Recognizing these standards
in new, unseen code can very often lead to an easy bugfix, even if one doesn’t
understand every single expression. In fact, complete and total comprehension of
code (that is to say, a deep understanding of every line, expression and
statement) is not only <em>not necessary</em> when debugging, but it can actually be
distracting. When you’re asked to fix a piece of code or predict its output, the
solution is rarely found in the lowest level of abstraction. Developer
communities use coding standards precisely to help themselves maintain
consistency throughout the codebase, to debug programs faster, and, most
crucially, make the code easier for newcomers.</p>
<p>This is why libraries in the scientific Python stack (like scikit-learn) are
<em>beautiful</em>. Let me tell you how.</p>
<p>In a previous life, I used to work in <a href="https://enthought.com">Enthought’s</a> buildsystem team. Python
package management back then wasn&rsquo;t nearly as mature as it is. Tools like pip
were a distant dream, and people used to joke that we ought to have a package
manager named &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; - &ldquo;maybe install&rdquo;, &ldquo;maybe upgrade&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybe remove&rdquo; a
package. Our job in the Enthought buildsystem was to build and package various
Python libraries so they could be sold to customers. These packages were usually
built from source. Python packaging being what it was, almost everything we
built would break once in a while, on some OS or platform.</p>
<p>So we internalized a rule - <em>upstream is always broken</em>. Since we couldn’t sell
broken packages, we had to patch them ourselves. We had patches for almost
<em>every</em> Python package that existed. In the two years that I spent in the
buildsystem team, I remember only 3 Python packages that <em>never</em> had to be
patched - <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html">requests</a>, <a href="https://ipython.org/">ipython</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>.</p>
<p>Like the developers of many popular open-source libraries, the developers of
sklearn have been highly dedicated to coding standards. In 2011, at the <a href="https://scipy.in/scipyin/2011/">SciPy
India</a> conference, I had the good fortune of showing some of my badly written
code to <a href="https://gael-varoquaux.info/">Gael Varoquaux</a>. He said a lot of things about my code, most of them
good. But he also emphatically kept pointing out that my code had no docstrings.
I said “Really? You think that’s the biggest problem with this code?” And sure
enough, scikit-learn&rsquo;s <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html">contribution guide</a> emphasizes coding standards.</p>
<p>The effects of this dedication are obvious to anyone who has spent a reasonable
time using the sklearn API. This is why I can recognize sklearn code from a mile
away. I know how sklearn developers divide their API neatly into only a few
types of classes and functions (their use of abstractions and interfaces would
make Java programmers jealous), and that piece of knowledge makes it easy for me
to identify when a transformer is being confused for an estimator.</p>
<p>Similar praise is due to the other no-patch libraries too - requests is an
example of how good Python code is supposed to be written, and IPython
represents an entire ecosystem built out of Python&rsquo;s metaprogramming
capabilities. Any Pythonista&rsquo;s (and especially, any data scientist&rsquo;s) very life
is shaped by these libraries.</p>
<p>And none of that is possible without code that is, as Abelson and Sussman wrote,
&ldquo;written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="good-code--good-communication">Good Code = Good Communication</h2>
<p>Until now, I thought that the quote above was from Donald Knuth. But since I
needed to paraphrase it here, I went around looking for its origin. All along, I
had it right here in my room, albeit in one of the least read books in one of
the dustier corners of my bookshelf. The quote is from the preface to the first
edition of SICP.</p>
<p>Reading the preface again after all these years is a revelation. For ages, I
have thought that SICP was a very&hellip; serious and hardcore programming textbook,
and the authors would not have bothered with something peripheral like
communication. That particular outlook was perhaps one of my own first mistakes
as a novice programmer - the very mistake that I&rsquo;m now cribbing about. That
incorrect outlook towards programming - that it&rsquo;s all about clever algorithms,
efficiency and managing complexity - must be why I rushed to acquire a copy of
SICP, barely touched it later, and then, years later, come around to the idea of
code as communication.</p>
<p>The authors of SICP mention that most of their students &quot; have had little or no
prior formal training in computation, although many have played with computers a
bit and a few have had extensive programming or hardware-design experience.&quot;
This is very similar to the situation I described earlier about my classmates at
IIT-M. The authors further write,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our goal is that students who complete this subject should have a good feel</em>
<em>for the elements of style and the aesthetics of programming. They should have</em>
<em>command of the major techniques for controlling complexity in a large system.</em>
<em>They should be capable of reading a 50-page-long program, if it is written in</em>
<em>an exemplary style. They should know what not to read, and what they need not</em>
<em>understand at any moment. They should feel secure about modifying a program,</em>
<em>retaining the spirit and style of the original author.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here&rsquo;s one of the greatest programming textbooks of all time, emphasizing
style, aesthetics and abstraction. I don&rsquo;t know of any other programming 101
content that takes this stand.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve had my share of being in software development and data science teams which
thought that clean code was a luxury they couldn&rsquo;t afford. My experience has
taught me that clean code helps even novices, and the lack of it hurts even
experts. What makes clean code hard to sell is that clean code is more about
the long-term health and stability of a project than about the short-term skill
of an individual programmer. So, as vindicated as I feel about this idea, it&rsquo;s
not exactly something I can preach to a bunch of exasperated kids who are
chasing homework deadlines.</p>
<p>Perhaps, we all need to take our time. Let&rsquo;s just hope that it&rsquo;s not so long
that our textbooks turn to dust.</p>

<p>I may have spent those many hours with Python (and its ecosystem of data
science libraries), bash, SQL and even HTML + JavaScript - but it&rsquo;s precisely
this expertise that makes you jaded. I realized early on that I was somewhat
blind to the problems that novices first face with these technologies. There
were questions about things I&rsquo;ve taken for granted all these years - and the
best students will always ask more than the best mentors can answer. If someone
asks why iteration ought to be avoided in numpy, one can certainly do better
than mumble something about vectorization. If someone asks why
list comprehensions might be preferred over <code>for</code> loops<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, one can&rsquo;t
just cling to their influences and wave the question off. When you try to
explain why the choice of a web framework isn&rsquo;t nearly as important as learning
how to build a RESTful API, you have to remember to keep evangelism aside.
