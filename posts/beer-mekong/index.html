<p>It’s easy to dismiss New Year’s Day as just another revolution around the sun -
an arbitrary checkpoint which carries no inherent meaning. But then all
checkpoints and milestones are arbitrary. Who’s to say that 17 year and 11
months old teenager is significantly less mature than an 18 year-old adult? We
have milestones because they’re convenient. So in the spirit of benchmarking
convenience, perhaps it is not such a bad idea to stick to resolutions, goals
and plans.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>I have absolutely no idea what mine are at this point in time - and frankly, I
don’t care that I don’t know.</p>
<p>I’m just back from a lovely trip to Laos and Cambodia. The trip was long enough
that I reached a point of detachment - from everything that has been plaguing me
for the last few years. I did not worry about work or studies for a second. I
did not worry about family or relationships. I did worry a bit about my dog -
she has separation anxiety. Staying away from me for ten days isn’t the most
pleasant experience for her. I worried that she may not be eating or sleeping
well enough. She’s back home now, and in a couple of days will have made a full
recovery - as if I’d never left her at a boarding centre for ten days. The folks
at the boarding centre kept sending me daily videos of her trotting about the
yard - she certainly didn’t look her playful self, but mostly she looked okay.</p>
<p>All in all, I was carefree enough that the whole trip felt like
a long and deep meditative experience. It was just me and the Mekong. It was
just me and the grand sunlit spires of Angkor Wat. It was just me and bustle of
the night market in Luang Prabang.</p>
<p>So that’s one resolution right there - find more such meditative experiences
(preferably without international travel). A big reason why I haven’t had more
such experiences is because of the tyranny (or perhaps the convenience) of
routine. Routine is easy, we’re creatures of habit. The obvious, and perhaps
healthy antidote to routine is controlled randomization and experimentation (I
wonder what it would take to do that).</p>
<p>The thing about sublime experiences is that there’s something elemental,
something ineffable about them. Mountain-gorges, oceans and dense jungles have
that quality - as if one should fall silent in their presence. Checking your
phone is an affront to the deep, still river - it demands, and manages to obtain
the toll of singular, unflinching attention. That is the key to deep experience.
You can only watch, listen, hear and smell. Trying to find the right frame for a
picture, or trying to think of the right words to caption that picture, even
pausing to point out a unique feature of the landscape to your co-traveller -
all of this is blasphemy. You can only be still and soak it in. Any worldly or
manifest deviation from this trance like state is irreverent. The only
acceptable indulgence is fish, bananas and quiet swigs of chilled beer.</p>
<p>It’s a state which can only be induced by a true force of nature. So there’s the
second resolution - find more forces of nature. Find stuff that makes you feel
like you’d better keep quiet. That would need travel. But travel takes it’s
toll - and I’m not young anymore. And there’s the third resolution - to be
healthy enough to travel. To be healthy enough that 15000 steps on the first
day of vacation doesn’t look like a big deal. To be healthy enough that a
ten-day trip (even if it’s to southeast Asia) doesn’t induce a fever at the end.</p>
<hr>
<p>A huge chapter of my life - one that began with the pandemic, one that included
a lot of personal and professional upheaval - drew to an end in December 2025. I
graduated from IIT Madras and around the same time, took a sabbatical from
work. The four years of the <a href="https://study.iitm.ac.in">BS Degree Program</a> have been a turning point - I’ve
discovered that not only am I a good student, I actually have a good flair for
teaching as well. I’ve taught many courses over the years, most of which were
very well received - but now I know that I can pull off a sustained and tangible
long-term teaching and learning. My six-year stint at Gramener also came to an
(albeit temporary) end. That’s the longest I have spent in any one place since I
left my childhood home 18 years ago. I learnt most of what I knew at Gramener -
and I did some of the coolest work of my career there. I doubt if I’ll ever be
able to pull that off again. It’s no wonder that breaking free of these anchors,
heavy with a history of passion, feels liberating. When I told
<a href="https://s-anand.net">Anand</a>, my
boss, that I
wanted a break, he agreed, and said that it was time for me to “spread my
wings”. It feels good to be a feather in the wind.</p>
<p>Then there’s the usual resolutions about reading, learning a new language,
eating and sleeping better, etc. I’ve made and broken them so many times that
calling them resolutions is embarrassing. For instance, it’s not like I don’t
read enough, but all I have to show for my reading resolution in 2024 are two
brand new bookshelves and a hundred fresh, unopened books. I also got three
books signed by their authors but I’ve read none of them beyond the first few
chapters. Reading, in and of itself, can be a sufficiently transcendental
experience. But for that I have to work hard to turn my living room (or my
veranda, when the is out) into a fortress of solitude.</p>

<p>It is instead easier to leash the dog and walk off to a nearby park with a book
under my arm. Unfortunately it’s still cloudy (and cold) in Delhi.</p>
<p>I recently met <a href="https://www.amitavakumar.com/">Amitava Kumar</a> at a local bookstore. He was there to launch his
<a href="https://www.amitavakumar.com/books/">latest book</a>. When we spoke, I told him bravely that I was going on a sabbatical
to “write more”. He asked me what about, and I said that I’m going to write
about walking my dog. I was only half-truthful. Drafts upon drafts of about
Cookie’s daily walks are lying around, and I haven’t finished a single one of
them. Cookie hasn’t eaten my homework either.</p>
<p>And then there are unfinished drafts about so many other things - about my
conversations with friends about the impostor syndrome, about how different
authors end an essay, about technical debt, about teaching and learning data
science and programming… (all of these phrases better be hyperlinked with the
finished posts by the end of the year, I tell myself). So writing needs to be a
resolution - much more than reading.</p>
<p>Finally, there are resolutions about hard skills, vocation and career capital. I
decided to take a break from work because it had become increasingly apparent
that I was spending more time solving people’s communication problems that their
technical problems. “Welcome to management!” said <a href="https://svs.io">SVS</a> when I told him this.
Moreover, technical problems that emerge from bad communication are the worst of
the lot - and I don’t get paid nearly enough for solving them. Anand says that
communicating clearly in code <em>and</em> in English is a rare skill. If that’s the
case, perhaps crafting a niche role for myself is in order, and that’s going to
take some work. My sabbatical could not have been timed better.</p>
<p>I started by saying that I didn’t know, and didn’t care, what my resolutions and
goals were. But taking the time to ruminate upon and discover resolutions (in no
small part by writing this) seems to have illuminated at least a few lighthouses
on the horizon. The fortitude and discipline needed to sail to them in time -
that remains another matter entirely.</p>
<p>But here’s to the first steps…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where
they should be. Now put the foundations under them.”</p>
<p>- Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></p>
