        <p><em>To the memory of Kevin Conroy. There was only ever one true Batman.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You have been playing for months. Slowly and steadily, you have harvested every
collectable - making yourself stronger and stronger until you can kill the
toughest enemies. Every enemy defeated, every monster slain. No side quest worth
doing remains.
Those not worth doing are also done because you are a
completionist (which is a dignified way of saying that you have no life). No
part of the open world remains unexplored - you have climbed the tallest
mountain and dived the deepest sea. All of this, you have done on the highest
difficulty level. All the DLC is exhausted, too. The strongest creature in the world
is you.</p>

<p>What do you do now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no
more worlds to conquer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post is woven out of several journal entries I wrote about games I
have played and some of the most important books I have read recently. This is
not a thesis or a contention - it is simply an exploration of loosely, tenuously
connected themes I found in games and books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of
happiness.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><cite> - Albert Camus</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I never really knew what people mean by grinding in video games. When I did hear
the word, I certainly did not appreciate its negative connotations. My
brother used to grumble about how collecting Riddler
trophies became a “chore” (it is
<a href="https://youtu.be/tFvXeA4VeQo">one of the most hated things</a> among otherwise
fanatic <em>Batman: Arkham</em> players). I would dismiss the grumbling thinking that
collecting those trophies was simply an optional part of the game - you did not
<em>have</em> to do it. In the Arkham games, side missions have no consequence apart from the
XP boosts. They do not add to or take away anything from the gameplay
experience.</p>
<p>Then, <em>Arkham Knight</em> came along. As I neared the end of the game, I realized that
I could not sustain my attitude towards Riddler trophies. <em>Arkham Knight</em> rewards
you for being a completionist - complete the whole game and you are rewarded
with a breathtaking cutscene (I won’t spoil it here, but search for “the
Knightfall Protocol” on YouTube). Unfortunately, reaching a 100% meant collecting all
of the Riddler trophies - all 243 of them - which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z42O_hS_y-8&amp;ab_channel=JaxonPham">maddening</a>.
Now I knew what my brother meant.</p>
<p>And even going around collecting the trophies is not <em>grinding</em> in the true
sense of the word. A grinding process in a well-designed crafting system not only inches
you towards the 100% completion, but also makes your character better and
stronger (Arkham games don&rsquo;t have a very sophisticated crafting system or build
tree). It wasn’t until I played <em>Fallout 4</em> that I really understood this. In
<em>Fallout 4</em>, I’ve spent hours scouring the wasteland on foot, scavenging for rare
materials (like lead or adhesive) so I could use them to build better
radiation-resistant armour or
weapons to kill special enemies.
Even though I spent more time scavenging in <em>Fallout 4</em> than collecting
Riddler trophies in <em>Arkham Knight</em> - the former felt a lot more rewarding,
because it was building up to something more than just a cutscene (albeit a
spectacular one).</p>
<p>The hours spent wandering the wasteland in <em>Fallout 4</em> quickly became days and
weeks and months. And then, in early 2020, I acquired the mother of all open
world games - <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>. This was just before the pandemic, and the
lockdown meant that I’d have a lot more time to play games. What was months for
<em>Fallout 4</em> became years for <em>the Witcher</em>. I’m playing the game to this day, and
I’m not done. I still have more character builds to try, difficulty levels to
beat, potions to brew and in-game choice trees to explore (there are nearly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0-e0QE2Eg4&amp;ab_channel=IGN">40
different ways</a> to
end that game).</p>
<p>I have no reasonable answer for why I’m still playing that game 3 years later.
The YouTube channel Gameological Dig makes an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlnzZU12oH8&amp;ab_channel=GameologicalDig">excellent attempt</a> to explain what
made <em>the Witcher 3</em> revolutionary. The sophisticated crafting system, the
poignant writing, pacing and the stellar voice acting all contribute to the
appeal of the game. As the video states, every interaction with side characters
is heavy with personal history and emotion. This makes it easy to justify side
quests. In addition to these, there are plenty of design principles which the
developers
have employed which make the game more addictive. Moreover, it is a game based
on a well known series of fantasy books - so the game world is already full of
myth and lore (something that is absent in Fallout). The open world itself is
very detailed (CD Project Red invented the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9ccQCAqgU&amp;ab_channel=LukeStephens">30 second rule</a> to keep the world engaging.
The YouTuber Luke Stephens has a fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a20rYOIY0gk&amp;ab_channel=LukeStephens">series</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmgj3oiFhFc&amp;&amp;ab_channel=LukeStephens">videos</a> where he has applied
this rule to various games, including <em>the Witcher 3</em>, to see how it affects the
game).
Finally, the combat isn’t all hacking and slashing - you have to pause and think
hard before engaging an enemy (it takes preparation within the game too).</p>
<p>And yet, none of this saves me from the bleak moment that comes at the end of
the game. In that moment, I am Sisyphus, watching the rock roll hopelessly to the bottom of the
mountain.</p>
<p>Yes, I do look forward to the next playthrough - this time, perhaps on
a higher difficulty level, or with a different set of weapons. “I’ll have to
build my character all over gain, that will take weeks…”, I think with a groan.
But I still do it. All to check off an arbitrary item on an invisible to-do
list. And if I do manage to finish this invisible to-do list, there will be another
one for another game. And I’ll keep pushing that boulder up the hill over and
over again.</p>
<h2 id="one-must-imagine-sisyphus-happy">One must imagine Sisyphus happy</h2>
<p>Open world games are absurd and thoroughly meaningless. But then, so is life.
Like in the games, the moral or economic worth of whatever we seek in life is
determined by a wholly arbitrary value system. Just how arbitrary these value
systems are is a discussion which would exhaust all conscious thought in the
universe, if we let it. What matters is that they <em>are</em> arbitrary. If they
were not, there would be no room for more than one religion or ideology. Only a
Descartes would have the courage to question whether an ideology has been merely
dreamt up, or if it is the result of critical scrutiny. The rest of us do not
have the time to subject everything, everyday to scepticism.</p>
<p>And thus, the void
left behind by the absence of critical judgement starts getting filled with
Sisyphean systems - just like in the games. We dream up minimaps, side-quests
and collectathons in life, just like in the games. These dreamt
up objectives seem meaningful to us only because other people believe them to be
meaningful. They are worth whatever we, as a civilization, decide they are
worth.</p>
<p>But the world is indifferent to it. As Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The foremost reason happiness is so hard to achieve is that the universe was not
designed with the comfort of human beings in mind&hellip; natural processes do not
take human desires into account.&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is natural that Csikszentmihalyi, as the
foremost expert on enjoyment, begins his book with a chapter titled
&ldquo;Happiness Revisited&rdquo;. But it is just as unsurprising that the focal point of
this chapter is a section titled &ldquo;The Roots of Discontent&rdquo; (I refer to
Csikszentmihalyi and his book several times in this article. It is a matter of
some pride to me that by the time I am drafting this, I can finally pronounce and
spell his last name without assistance.) He echoes Camus' suggestion of a happy
Sisyphus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as
we enjoy the struggle along the way. The problem arises when people are so
fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the
present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as your life is indifferent to what
your character does within a game (unless you’re a professional gamer),
the universe is also indifferent to whatever invisible checklist you
write for yourself. This is not difficult to see. But once seen, it cannot be
unseen. Trying to reconcile the indifferent universe
with human endeavour (or failing to doing so) is at the very root of existential thought. Becoming
conscious of the pointlessness of this uphill task has inspired centuries of
lament. The very awareness of this
problem is the real problem. It is no
accident that the greatest soliloquy written in the English language is &ldquo;To be,
or not to be, that is the question&hellip;&quot;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. It ends with a
conclusion that seems all too inevitable - &ldquo;conscience makes cowards of us all&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This realisation is crippling. If nothing matters, why bother doing anything at all? This
paralyzing thought echoes throughout history. It was there long before
Shakespeare or Camus. And it will be there, as long as there is a place in the
universe where conscious thought exists. It is central to the human condition.
Dostoevsky wrote, in <em>Notes from the Underground</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the direct, immediate, legitimate fruit of heightened consciousness is
inertia, that is, the deliberate refusal to do anything… all spontaneous
people, men of action, are active because they are stupid and limited.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib
(who was both a notorious cynic and a hopeless romantic - I see no contradiction),
wrote along similar lines</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prison of life and bonds of sorrow are one and the same.
Why, then, should one be free of suffering whilst they live?</p>
<p>Why despair, O Ghalib! The world will go on, even without you.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inevitability of this despair is thus established. After the despair comes
acceptance. And it is only from this acceptance that hope can sprout. Camus, in
his essays on absurdism acknowledges that the most important question in life is
whether it is worth living. He ruthlessly simplifies the problem by introducing
a proxy - &ldquo;There is but one serious philosophical problem and that is
suicide.&quot;<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
This brutal simplification is necessary, it strips off the convenience of
misinterpretation. He argues further that it is only when confronted with this stark
realization, that we can truly begin to fix the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sisyphus… knows the whole extent of his wretched condition; it is what he
thinks of during this descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture
at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be
surmounted by scorn.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need not even arrive at this acceptance from a
metaphysical perspective, like Camus did. The journalist Oliver Burkeman suggests that not only is
acceptance of the absurd eminently
practical, it may even be therapeutic!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control -
when the flood of emails has been contained; when your to-do lists have
stopped getting longer; when you&rsquo;re meeting all your obligations at work and
in your home life; when nobody&rsquo;s angry with you for missing a deadline or
dropping the ball; and when the fully optimized person you&rsquo;ve become can turn,
at long last, to the things life is really supposed to be about. Let&rsquo;s start
by admitting defeat: none of this is ever going to happen.</p>
<p>But you know what? That&rsquo;s <em>excellent</em> news.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis in original)</p>
<p>This is how Burkeman concludes the introduction to his book
<em>Four Thousand Weeks - Time Management for Morals</em>. The remainder of the book is
a refreshing, subversive take on productivity - exhorting readers to instead
embrace their finitude, and appreciate what they really <em>can</em> exercise control over.
Csikszentmihalyi lays the foundations of the flow experience in very much the same
terms.</p>

    <img class="article-image" src="/posts/myth-of-sisyphus/cookie-popcorn.jpg" alt="Dog, Beer and Popcorn">
    


<p>My wife takes a brief summer vacation every year. This is when I usually catch up on my gaming.
I pour myself a beer, make some popcorn (although it is more for my dog&rsquo;s benefit -
nothing makes her sit quietly by my side like the smell of popcorn). I also use
this time to catch up on my other hobbies and side-projects. This year, my
wife’s travels ended up lasting three weeks. I spent all that time playing
<em>God of War (2018)</em> and reading Csikszentmihalyi. In any other year, I would have
just replayed <em>Arkham Knight</em>, <em>Fallout 4</em> or <em>The Witcher</em>. But this year, one of the
most anticipated entries in the <em>God of War</em> franchise, <em>God of War: Ragnarök</em> was going to come
out in November. I&rsquo;d had it&rsquo;s prequel lying around for ages which I&rsquo;d never started playing.
So I started playing it - mostly as homework for <em>Ragnarök</em>.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t stop playing it!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently in my first NG+ playthrough. Like other games, its the side quests
that make it addictive. I absolutely loved hunting down the Valkyries and
painstakingly learning how to defeat them.
When I played the game a second time, I got to them as
quickly as possible. <em>God of War</em> takes place across the multiple realms of Norse
myth, of which two realms - Muspelheim (the fire
realm) and Niflheim (the fog realm) - are optional; you can finish
the game without setting foot in them. The first time I played the game, I went
through the rigmarole of  playing through them simply because I didn’t know
better, and I needed the loot there for upgrading weapons and armour. Once I was
done with them, I would never go back. But during my second playthrough, I
realized that I kept going back to both Muspelheim and Niflheim every time
I was bored with the main storyline (which takes place in the default realm -
Midgard).</p>
<p>This was remarkable. What seemed a
punishment once had become something I looked forward to.
I realized that after a very long time, I was actually enjoying the experience more than
the rewards!</p>
<p>How do these side quests go from annoying distractions to becoming the central
purpose of the game? How do you get a player to ignore the central storyline? I
imagine that like me, most gamers, are in it for the story and the campaign.
What do designers do that brings about such a significant change in the players'
attitude? Side quests are the most ridiculous things to be addicted to. But I
can’t describe in words the sense of satisfaction I’d get when Kratos
successfully beats a Valkyrie and rips her wings off (but not before she
<a href="https://youtu.be/-b-DaQGKlUg?t=61">literally wipes the floor</a> with him many times over).
I’ve never felt that kind of satisfaction in any other game.</p>
<p>It’s because of the loop that the game has instilled in my mind. The loop has a
sense of familiarity that would take me weeks to build in any other game
(perhaps with the exception of the <em>Arkham</em> games - renowned for their
revolutionary combat system). Try hitting, get hit, learn how to hit well, learn
how to not get hit, learn enemy moves,
get better weapons, defeat harder enemies, earn rewards, <em>ad inifitum</em><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.
Keep doing this until there&rsquo;s a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Sure, this sense of achievement is based on a wholly arbitrary checkpoint - but
that does not bother me anymore. The game, thus, has done something remarkable.
It has made me addicted, but not
in a mindless way. It definitely takes skill, patience and practice to do well.
I&rsquo;d go so far as to say that it takes study. It has converted something
Sisyphean into something heavily, obsessively sought.
I&rsquo;d need coffee before beginning to code,
but I could probably be sleep deprived and still play God of War for hours and
hours. How does a game accomplish all of this? Perhaps the answer lies in what
Csikszentmihalyi calls the <em>conditions of Flow</em>.</p>



    <img class="article-image" src="/posts/myth-of-sisyphus/flow-channel.png" alt="">
    


<p>While Csikszentmihalyi devotes an entire chapter to the conditions conducive to
flow, I think the single most important condition is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; enjoyment comes at a very specific point: whenever the opportunities for
action (challenges) perceived by the individual are equal to his or her capabilities<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chart above highlights a &ldquo;flow channel&rdquo; - the region where the player&rsquo;s
skills and the challenges they face are commensurate. If a non-skilled player
faces a difficult challenge, they become anxious. If a skilled player faces an
easy task, they get bored.</p>
<p>Video games have solved this problem. Most modern games begin with
tutorials disguised as stories - players usually don&rsquo;t even realize that
they&rsquo;re being taught. Enemy upscaling is an absolute life-saver in <em>The Witcher</em>
(eventually Geralt becomes so powerful that defeating enemies becomes boring -
unless the player decides to turn on the enemy upscaling feature). In <em>God of
War</em>, the Valkyries are easily the toughest bosses - who are usually located in
isolated areas known as &ldquo;Odin&rsquo;s Hidden Chambers&rdquo;. The game does not let you
simply walk into one of these - essentially ensuring that you have done your
homework. Thus, video game design has grown to navigate the flow
channel remarkably well, by employing various mechanics such as in-game
tutorials, scaling enemies, and ensuring that the players don&rsquo;t end up in
dangerous situations prematurely.</p>
<p>Csikszentmihalyi, too, emphasizes design heavily. When mentioning activities
that his respondents described as &ldquo;flow inducing&rdquo;, he further deconstructs the
conditions of flow as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes these activities conducive to flow is that they were <em>designed</em> to
make optimal experience easier to achieve. They have rules that require the
learning of skills, they set up goals, they provide feedback, and they make
control possible<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis in original)</p>
<p>The lead gameplay designer on God of War, Jason McDonald, mirrors these ideas in his
<a href="https://youtu.be/kX8Jn3XPoWQ">talk about reinventing God of War&rsquo;s gameplay</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, it seems that achieving flow is a matter of good design. So, if
Sisyphus' environment - the rock and the mountain included - was designed well
enough, could we get him to enjoy himself? Further, his life and his universe,
unlike ours, is not chaotic. On the one hand we have a Sisyphean rut, and on the
other, the ineffable chaos of daily life. These are two extremes of a spectrum.
Do all our activities sit on this spectrum?</p>
<p>It is certainly tempting to think so. The closer something is to the Sisyphean end,
the better suited it is for gamification. On the other hand, something that is
closer to the chaotic end is, to begin with, not boring.
But that alone does not make it fun. We still have to seek <em>some</em> order in the chaos.</p>
<p>We are thus left with a precarious tradeoff.
But as it turns out, there is little merit in actually solving it - even if you
had the godlike ability to do so.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-is-today---ragnarök-is-now">The Future is Today - Ragnarök is Now</h2>
<p>There seems to be deep-seated cultural,
perhaps even religious, motivation for solving this tradeoff. Almost all
religious cosmologies in the west are linear. We&rsquo;re all headed somewhere,
hopefully to a peaceful void. As Charles Dickens wrote in <em>A Christmas Carol</em>,
we&rsquo;re all fellow passengers to the grave. The abstract future thus
becomes some fixed point in time; even if, paradoxically, we have no idea how
far we are from it. It is natural, then, that we want to pull our lives away
from the chaos and towards order - hopefully well before Armageddon.</p>
<p>Eschatology in the east,
however, is either cyclic (like in Hinduism or Buddhism) or simply absent (like
in the Tao or Shinto). Future never comes because everywhen is simultaneously the past
and the future of sometime else. (The only western
myth that has a cyclic religious cosmology is Norse. It is in this
mythology that the latest <em>God of War</em> games are set - what a delicious
coincidence!)</p>
<p>In the same spirit, Burkeman makes an argument that the future will never arrive - at
least not the future we plan for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; you can&rsquo;t depend on fulfilment arriving at some distant point in the
future, once you&rsquo;ve got your life in order, or met the world&rsquo;s critera for
success.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This supposedly ideal future is problematic because there is no progress bar to
tell us how close we are (one of the universally hated things in gaming, too,
is an invisible progress bar). Sure, we replace the progress bar with
checkpoints - finishing college, getting a job, doing great work, having great
relationships, retiring, dying.</p>
<p>But, look around yourself - I bet the happiest
and most interesting people you know have little respect for progress bars or
checkpoints. They might have finished college but they are constantly learning.
Getting a good job isn&rsquo;t a checkpoint for them - they&rsquo;ve transcended that. They
thrive on challenges, and they certainly don&rsquo;t intend to retire. These are
people who possess, as Csikszentmihalyi calls it, an <em>autotelic self</em><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.
They identify challenges and set goals. They are capable of getting fully
immersed in activity - with sustained, active attention. And above all, they&rsquo;ve
learned to enjoy immediate experience. In other words, they&rsquo;ve transcended
existential dread.</p>
<p>Call one of them right now.</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s the end of 2022. Gaming consoles aren&rsquo;t getting any cheaper since the global
chip shortage, but I&rsquo;m finally going to play <em>God of War: Ragnarök</em> before the year ends.</p>
<p>It is only from the debris of Ragnarök that hope can sprout. And I have exactly the right
book to help me with making the most of the debris: Tim Harford&rsquo;s <em>Messy: How to
be Resilient in a Tidy-minded World</em>.</p>
