      <title>A Process for Readable Code</title>

      <description>I took a course on data structures and algorithms over the last few months. It is being offered as a part of IIT Madras&amp;rsquo; Online Degree Program in Data Science and Programming, taught by Prof Madhavan Mukund. The program is a MOOC in a true sense, with tens of thousands of students enrolling each year. The DSA course itself is offered every trimester, and sees an average of ~700 enrollments every time.</description>

      <title>Rabies, Laziness &amp; Privilege</title>

      <description>It was the night of the recent 5-state assembly elections. One of my company&amp;rsquo;s clients is a major news channel, and I was at the studio late into the night, until the election commission announced that they had cancelled their press conference which was supposed to make an announcement about the final vote counts in Madhya Pradesh. A colleague offered to drop me home, and I got off at the gate of my colony, not wanting to subject my colleague to navigating the labyrinth that is any gated colony in South Delhi.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow up to my talk, Practical Image Classification &amp;amp; Object Detection at PyData Delhi 2018. You can watch the talk here:   and see the slides here.
I spoke at length about the different kinds of problems in computer vision and how they are interpreted in deep learning architectures. I spent a fair bit of time on instance and semantic segmentation (for an introduction to these problems, watch Justin Johnson&amp;lsquo;s lecture from the Stanford CS231 course here).</description>

      <title>Playing With the Konmari Method</title>

      <description>I heard about the bestseller The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up at a SciPy talk about deculttering your data science project. The speakers admitted they hadn&amp;rsquo;t read it - they were simply trying to point out that tidying up your space and tidying up your software project are both similar.
  I&amp;rsquo;ve been married and living with my wife for about a year now. After we moved into &amp;ldquo;our own home&amp;rdquo; last year, we have both undergone major role reversals when it comes to tidying up.</description>

      <title>On the Linearity of Bayesian Classifiers</title>

      <description>In his book, Neural Networks - A Comprehensive Foundation, Simon Haykin has an entire section (3.10) dedicated to how perceptrons and Bayesian classifiers are closely related when operating in a Gaussian environment. However, it is not until the end of the section that Haykin mentions that the relation is only limited to linearity. What is interesting about this is that a Perceptron can produce the same classification &amp;ldquo;model&amp;rdquo; as a Bayesian classifier, provided that the underlying data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <description>The last time I studied neural networks in detail was five years ago in college. I did touch upon backpropagation when Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s machine learning MOOC was offered on Coursera for the first time, but beyond that I&amp;rsquo;ve only dabbled with them through keras. Then recently, when I read about Coursera&amp;rsquo;s imminent decision to pull down much of their freely available material (you can read a rant about it here), I went on a downloading spree (many thanks to the wonderful coursera-dl).</description>

      <title>Understanding Allen Downey&#39;s Solution to the M&amp;M Problem</title>
      <link>https://jaidevd.com/posts/mm-problem/</link>

      <description>Allen Downey makes a very good case for learning advanced mathematics through programming (Check the first section of the preface of Think Bayes, titled &amp;ldquo;My theory, which is mine&amp;rdquo;). But before the reader can hit paydirt with using the Bayes theorem in programming, Downey makes you go through some elementary problems in probability, which have to be solved by hand first, if you expect to have a clear enough understanding of the concept.</description>

      <title>Evangelism in Foss</title>
      <link>https://jaidevd.com/posts/evangelism-in-foss/</link>

      <description>One of the most dangerous things that can affect any FOSS community is the tendency of evangelism for the sake of evangelism. Promoting the Python stack, expanding the userbase, etc, should come only as a consequence of the content we produce as developers. If evangelism even remotely becomes one of your goals, your quality is sure to suffer. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just the empirical evidence that prompts me to say this.</description>

      <title>Organizing a Bookshelf with Multivariate Analysis</title>

      <description>I have recently moved from Pune to Delhi. I had spent only a year in Pune, having moved there from Mumbai, where I lived for three years. Whenever I move, the bulk of my luggage consists of books and clothes. My stay in Pune was just a transition, so I never bothered to unpack and store all my stuff too carefully. Thus, a corner of my bedroom in my Pune apartment always looked like this: The actual volume of books that I carried from Pune to Delhi is about twice of what is seen in the picture.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>My implementation of the Hilbert Huang transform (PyHHT) is quite close to a beta release. After nearly three years of inactivity, I&amp;rsquo;ve found some time to develop the PyHHT library in the last few weeks. In all this time many people have written to me about a lot of things - from the inability to use the module because of the lack of documentation, to comparison between the results of HHT and conventional time series analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Edge Effects in Empirical Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>It has been a little over three years since I started working on a Python implementation of the Hilbert Huang Transform. When I first presented it at SciPy India 2011 (video) it was just a collection of small scripts, without packaging, testing or even docstrings. Over time PyHHT has garnered some interest, and I have, since the last few weeks, found the time to regularly work on it. I have been able to come up with a decent implementation of empirical mode decomposition, pretty much in line with everything described in the original paper by Huang et al.</description>

      <description>Hello, World! I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist based in New Delhi, India. I build data-driven products and the tooling around them for a living. My research interests are in signal processing, machine learning and computational harmonic analysis. I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with applications of machine learning and statistics in day-to-day data and problems.</description>
