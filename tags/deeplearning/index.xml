You can watch the talk here: and see the slides here.
I spoke at length about the different kinds of problems in computer vision and how they are interpreted in deep learning architectures. I spent a fair bit of time on instance and semantic segmentation (for an introduction to these problems, watch Justin Johnson&amp;rsquo;s lecture from the Stanford CS231 course here).</description></item></channel></rss>
