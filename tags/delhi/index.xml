      <description>I was first introduced to William Dalrymple in Michael Wood&amp;rsquo;s documentary, The Story of India. I watched it nearly eight years ago. The scene was shot in a Kali temple where devotees had gathered on the eve of Holi. Dalrymple is explaining what Holi means to Hindus, looking at a spot slightly off-camera. The timing of his narration is such that as soon as he finishes talking, the nearly hundred devotees in the temple throw up their hands and started dancing to chants of &amp;ldquo;Jai Mata Di&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Holi hai&amp;rdquo;.</description>
