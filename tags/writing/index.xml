      <description>I went into this essay expecting Virginia Woolf had written about what the eponymous room is like - its design and contents. But she deals with a more fundamental issue - that one needs a room of one&amp;rsquo;s own.
The essays are a fine piece of scholarship. I&amp;rsquo;d never have thought that Woolf&amp;rsquo;s characteristic device, the &amp;ldquo;stream of consciousness&amp;rdquo; could be used to not only as a writing technique, but also as a powerful pedagogical technique.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a single fantasy character that would be Neil Gaiman. I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to think that he&amp;rsquo;s like Santa Claus, but he&amp;rsquo;s not the sort who&amp;rsquo;d care if someone was being naughty. He&amp;rsquo;s not Dumbledore or Gandalf either - he&amp;rsquo;d rather be your friend than your mentor. He&amp;rsquo;s not even the Dream of the Endless, since he&amp;rsquo;s not aware of how powerful he is.
Reading Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s nonfiction is like meditation that clears and even expands your mind.</description>
