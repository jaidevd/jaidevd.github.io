      <description>TL;DR: Here&amp;rsquo;s a talk based on this post:&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s an unavoidable, inherent difficulty in fine-tuning deep neural networks for specific tasks, which primarily stems from the lack of training data. It would seem ridiculous to a layperson that a pretrained vision model (containing millions of parameters, trained on millions of images) could learn to solve highly specific problems. Therefore, when fine-tuned models do perform well, they seem all the more miraculous.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow up to my talk, Practical Image Classification &amp;amp; Object Detection at PyData Delhi 2018. You can watch the talk here: and see the slides here.&#xA;I spoke at length about the different kinds of problems in computer vision and how they are interpreted in deep learning architectures. I spent a fair bit of time on instance and semantic segmentation (for an introduction to these problems, watch Justin Johnson&amp;rsquo;s lecture from the Stanford CS231 course here).</description>
