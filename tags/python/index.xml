      <description>I took a course on data structures and algorithms over the last few months. It is being offered as a part of IIT Madras&amp;rsquo; Online Degree Program in Data Science and Programming, taught by Prof Madhavan Mukund. The program is a MOOC in a true sense, with tens of thousands of students enrolling each year. The DSA course itself is offered every trimester, and sees an average of ~700 enrollments every time.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow up to my talk, Practical Image Classification &amp;amp; Object Detection at PyData Delhi 2018. You can watch the talk here:   and see the slides here.
I spoke at length about the different kinds of problems in computer vision and how they are interpreted in deep learning architectures. I spent a fair bit of time on instance and semantic segmentation (for an introduction to these problems, watch Justin Johnson&amp;lsquo;s lecture from the Stanford CS231 course here).</description>
