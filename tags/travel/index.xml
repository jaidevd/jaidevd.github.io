      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of 2020, and when you&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck at home for a year, with only your dog as your constant companion, Travels with Charley is a good book to read.
But this book is a lot more about Steinbeck&amp;rsquo;s road trip than about the dog.
Steinbeck romanticises everything. If so much as a tree sheds a leaf in front of him, he bursts forth with pages of ideas, thoughts and memories.</description>
