      <description>In his book, Neural Networks - A Comprehensive Foundation, Simon Haykin has an entire section (3.10) dedicated to how perceptrons and Bayesian classifiers are closely related when operating in a Gaussian environment. However, it is not until the end of the section that Haykin mentions that the relation is only limited to linearity. What is interesting about this is that a Perceptron can produce the same classification &amp;ldquo;model&amp;rdquo; as a Bayesian classifier, provided that the underlying data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <description>The last time I studied neural networks in detail was five years ago in college. I did touch upon backpropagation when Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s machine learning MOOC was offered on Coursera for the first time, but beyond that I&amp;rsquo;ve only dabbled with them through keras. Then recently, when I read about Coursera&amp;rsquo;s imminent decision to pull down much of their freely available material (you can read a rant about it here), I went on a downloading spree (many thanks to the wonderful coursera-dl).</description>
