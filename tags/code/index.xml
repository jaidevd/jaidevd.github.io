      <description>Over the last few years, I have been deeply involved with the IIT-M Programme in Data Science &amp;amp; Applications - as a student, a mentor and an analytics consultant.

      <description>I took a course on data structures and algorithms over the last few months. It is being offered as a part of IIT Madras&amp;rsquo; Online Degree Program in Data Science and Programming, taught by Prof Madhavan Mukund. The program is a MOOC in a true sense, with tens of thousands of students enrolling each year. The DSA course itself is offered every trimester, and sees an average of ~700 enrollments every time.</description>
