      <description>It has been a little over three years since I started working on a Python implementation of the Hilbert Huang Transform. When I first presented it at SciPy India 2011 (video) it was just a collection of small scripts, without packaging, testing or even docstrings. Over time PyHHT has garnered some interest, and I have, since the last few weeks, found the time to regularly work on it. I have been able to come up with a decent implementation of empirical mode decomposition, pretty much in line with everything described in the original paper by Huang et al.</description>
