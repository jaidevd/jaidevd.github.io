Hello, World!

I'm a data scientist based in New Delhi, India. I build data-driven products
and the tooling around them for a living. My research interests are in signal
processing and computational harmonic analysis. I'm obsessed with applications
of machine learning in personal productivity and recommendation systems. I blog
about these `here <link://post_path/blog/>`__.
