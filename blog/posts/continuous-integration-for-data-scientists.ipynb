    "Recently Peter Norvig was asked in a Q&A what he thinks about the place of software developers in machine learning research. And this is his answer. \"It's important for machine learning experts and software engineers to come together to develop best practices for the development of ML systems. We need new testing processes that involve running experiments and analyzing results\" and that \"this is a great area for software developers and ML expers to work together\". The interesting thing here is that Norvig is talking about testing not as quality control, but as a way of evaluating machine learning models. So this broadly the idea is what I'm going to speak about, today. When I say continuous integration, I don't literally mean CI. CI is a placeholder term for CI systems, devops, build, test and QA systems - and also the culture and habits that come with it."

    "So this here is a very broadly representative, a very general data processing pipeline. That box you see to the left is known as ETL part of the pipeline. ETL stands for extract, transform and load. You start with a source datastore, and end up in a sink datastore. The ETL part of the process is the most data-intensive one - by that I don't mean that others are not, it's just that this is the part where you treat your data for what it is - raw data. After it's left this box, it's no longer raw data, it's features, it's model coefficients, it's statistics, and so on. And it is in this box that your developer side has to be the most creative, as against your data scientist side, which has to show off outside the box. So after you've extracted, transformed and loaded your data, you train some model on it, and you do some validation which might allow you to do better model selection. Now, these steps - training, validation and model selection - are not necessarily well separated in time. You could be cross-validating one model while you are already training another model, and a third one could actually be in production that is writing the output to whatever your sink is. But the thing is that we tend to think about a pipeline as something sequential. You can't think if this as a pipeline. How do you bend the spoon? Think that there is no spoon. Think that there is no such pipeline, and each of these blocks are independent systems - these are microservices - which only happen to be loosely coupled."

    "Abstract away almost everything that has to do with ETL. We, as a community, the data science community, haven't paid much attention to it. Machine learning systems have grown super sophisticated while data management systems (that these same machine learning systems use), have trudged behind. Let's stop thinking of raw data as an inanimate entity that you only have to dig through before you can get the gold. The digging itself is part of your software, and is therefore subject to pretty much the same dangers as any other kind of software development. So build abstraction layers, services and all kinds of tooling that you would need around ETL. Now this might sound very obvious, but you'd be surprised at how infrequently we practice this. For example, almost all development data scientists do is based off local flatfiles - most of it actually happens within the ipython notebook. The excuse is that they're just building prototypes and it's not really their job to have to deploy their models on larger systems. But we know how fast the boundaries between data scientists and other kinds of developers are thinning. In that light, we have to learn to work with larger more intergated data sources. Even if you're just building a prototype, this is still not every healthy because you have no idea how long the prototyping is going to take, or how many intermediate files you might end up producing. So, at least as a favour to people who are deploying your work to larger systems, learn to use larger integrated systems. Even if you're using the Iris dataset, try to use sqlite instead of CSV. The cloud is your friend. The sooner you become comfortable with remote or cloud based distributed storages, the faster you can deploy your apps."

You take a directory with your data in it, add a json that describes that directory and Sputnik will make a tarball out of it, allowing you to deal with the whole thing in a very atomic manner. Datreant is another data management library that leverages the local filesystem itself. It's common to have a very messy filesystem, but datreant will exploit this mess to provide some sort of discoverability into your data. You can think of it as a tradeoff between the simplicity of rigid file structure and the heterogenous data storage functionality that your filesystem can provide. Then there is conduit - which is used for managing data for HPC simulations. It is essentially a data model for describing hierarchical datasets. So it represents your data as a graph - and this graph integrates seamlessly with the in-memory data, serialized on-disk data, etc. Finally there is PySemantic by yours truly - which automates all the pandas code you would write for validating and cleaning your dataset."

    "So that was all about data ingest. Now let's talk about automating machine learning. This is a very widely studied problem, and one of its most popular forms is the AutoML problem - also known as the CASH problem. CASH stands for Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization. The motivation for formally studying automation of machine learning is simple - no algorithm works best on all datasets, not even neural networks - and most algorithms are highly sensitive to hyperparameters. This here is a concise flowchart of the AutoML framework. The _xTrain, xTest, yTrain_ variables are as usual, L is the loss. The interesting thing here is b which denotes your budget - which could be time or processing power. The ML framework box here is as usual. There's a data preprocessor, which feeds into a feature extractor and then finally a classifier. The _Bayesian optimizer_ block is a process that fits a model between hyperparameters and performance. Actually take a moment to think about that. You want to automate the training of a model, and for that you're fitting a model which given another model and its hyperparameters, predicts the performance. The meta-learning block here also learns the performance, but the input to that is the dataset. So given a dataset, it predicts performance, you know, like a domain expert. So when we say that decision trees are likely to perform well for categorical variables - that is the sort of thing that the meta-learning block learns. Finally, we build ensembles from the different models that have been performing well. Thankfully, there's a convenient sklearn implementation of this - called auto-sklearn. This is what Andreas Mueller spoke about in his talk at SciPy this year. The idea is that if machine learning is so ubuquitous then one should be able to just use it without understanding the details. Now, if you think about it, this is exactly how sysadmins think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now allow me to digress a bit. About two years ago I used to work on the Enthought Python Distribution, or Canopy. I was briefly a part of the buildsystem team that was responsible for making Python packages that would work across many platforms and architectures reliably. One rule of thumb that the buildsystem team had was that _upstream is always broken_. If you built a Python package as-is from its source code repository - it was very likely that it would be broken for some platform. So we used to write our own patches to fix that. We had patches for almost every project which we would apply and then build the packages before distributing them. Sklearn is one precious few projects which did not require a patch. It's a wonderful library that you really should study. Like requests, its one of those projects that are an example of what good Python development should be like. So it's very natural that sklearn follows the Zen of Python. An sklearn developer would say that explicit is better than implicit. But a sysadmin would say, _is it really_? For sysadmins, things are so automated that its impossible to make them reasonably explicit. In fact, most sysadmins are reluctant even to update libraries lest it break something else. This is one of the reasons why enterprise Linux distros have outdated libraries. They just care about building and running stuff - which is another reason why projects like AutoML are useful. They allow you to run _a lot_ of models easily and in a hands-off manner."

    "But then, with great power comes great responsibilty. Automating machine learning is expensive. So formalize the search space mindfully. Think about which parameters are continuous or discrete. Especially in sklearn there are a _combinations_ of hyperparameters that are not compatible with themselves. When you are iterating though a grid, the  gridsearch reaches an incompatible set of hyperparamters, and fails. So unless you have been logging everything, you have to start all over again. Normally the habit is to stuff everything you can into the grid - but much of the grid can be restricted before you even start, if you think it through properly.\n",

There was an interesting talk at SciPy this year by Katie Malone about using tools from pyschometrics for data quality evaluation. Data quality is again not something we think of too often. We tend to be so preoccupied with model performance that we don't think of data quality as a measurable entity. Do look up the talk. In summary the talk says that predictive modeling is not the same as building a model. It needs to be more comprehensive than that, something with _insight_. So, iterating over different models shouldn't be limited to simply changing feature extraction or hyperparameter selection. You need to go all the way back to your data. This ties into what I meant when I spoke of data _farming_ instead of data mining. Have the same intuition for your data as you have for your model. Specifically, that means asking questions like what dataset would give me better performance for a fixed model. So essentially turn around your intuition about predictive modeling. You'll quite likely find that simpler models perform much better on good datasets, but if your data isn't good enough, even complex models won't do well. And there's of course the overhead of building and maintaining complex models that you may want to avoid."

The model was doing fairly well, but instead of pushing for an extra percent in classification accuracy, its better if I spend time visualizing the tree and its decision making process - its better to see how well the tree reflects our talk selection process rather than simply being a prediction model that tells you whether a talk is likely to be selected. I might do a lightning talk about this later during the conference. And in that spirit, the software should be modular with respect to,\n",

    "Finally we come to deployment. The easiest way to deploy models is to use simple serialization methods like pickle or json - sklearn's joblib will do great - and then writing wrappers around the serialized models on the client side - especially if its not a Python client. sklearn-compiledtrees is a project that compiles tree based models from sklearn into object code, which can then be read by the client. Now you _could_ port almost any machine learning algorithm to any platform, but if it's a linear model, then the advantage you have is that the client needs to compute only a dot product. So evaluate linear models first, and if you can't work with them, make absolutely sure that you can't."

    "An interesting deployment solution that has emerged recently is the serverless paradigm. Alex Casalboni is a developer at Cloudacademy where they are pioneering the serverless paradigm specially in the Python/Scikit-learn ecosystem. He says that the data science community is stuck at the level of designing ad-hoc models - which are mostly just prototype with very thin layers of customization. And they cannot be embedded or extended by other developers very easily. So the serverless paradigm is one of the ways in which you can make your prototypes production-ready without too much effort."

    "Now even if we want to keep things simple with simple serialization - its a lot of effort to scale it, and to make it distributed. And you will also have to put a lot of thought into how you expose the API and how can authenticate it. One of the easiest things you could do it write simple flask or django wrappers around your model and make the estimator methods available through HTTP requests - but even that doesn't provide enough elasticity, and scaling is still non trivial. AWS Lambda is a service that allows you to just deploy scripts onto AWS and it takes care of the scaling automatically. A combination of this and the Amazon API Gateway is all you need for deploying and scaling your scikit-learn code. But unsurprisingly, that's more on the expensive slide."
